Step 1: Data Preparation

Convert the PDF invoices into text format using libraries like pdfminer or PyPDF2 in Python. This will allow you to extract text from the PDF files and work with them in subsequent steps.

Step 2: Vendor Identification

Preprocess the invoice images to enhance quality if necessary. Techniques such as resizing, denoising, or contrast adjustment can be applied using image processing libraries like OpenCV.
Extract logos from the preprocessed invoice images using template matching or deep learning approaches.
Build a logo database by collecting a set of vendor logos. Ensure that the database includes a diverse range of logos that represent the vendors in your dataset.
Compare the extracted logos from the invoices with the logos in your database. Use feature matching or similarity measures like cosine similarity or SSIM to measure the similarity between the extracted logo and each logo in the database.
Associate the extracted logo with the vendor whose logo in the database yields the highest similarity score. This will help identify the vendor for each invoice.

Step 3: Invoice Template Classification

Prepare a labeled dataset where each invoice is associated with its template type (debit, credit, etc.). The labels can be manually assigned based on the template type of each invoice.
Extract relevant features from the invoices that can help in template classification. This can include text patterns, layout structure, specific keywords, or any other information that distinguishes one template type from another.
Train a machine learning model or deep neural network using techniques like logistic regression, random forest, or CNNs. The extracted features will serve as input to the model, and the template type labels will be used for training.
Split your dataset into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to train the model, while the testing set will be used to evaluate its performance. This ensures that you can assess how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data.

Step 4: Key-Value Pair Extraction

Use techniques like Named Entity Recognition (NER) or regular expression matching to extract key-value pairs from the invoices.
Identify the key fields in the invoices that you want to extract, such as invoice number, date, total amount, etc.
Apply NER models like spaCy or deep learning models like Bidirectional LSTMs to recognize and extract relevant entities from the text.
Alternatively, you can use regular expressions to match and extract specific patterns or keywords associated with key-value pairs.
Design a set of rules or patterns that guide the extraction process based on the structure and characteristics of the invoices in your dataset.

Step 5: Evaluation and Refinement

Evaluate the performance of each component (vendor identification, template classification, key-value pair extraction) using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score.
Fine-tune your models by adjusting parameters, experimenting with different algorithms, or incorporating additional features if necessary.
Iteratively refine the models and processes based on feedback and real-world performance. Continuously gather feedback from the outputs and make necessary adjustments to improve the accuracy and efficiency of your system.
